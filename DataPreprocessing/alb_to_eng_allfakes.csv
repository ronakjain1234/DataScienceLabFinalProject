"The return of Aya Sophia to the mosque, Greece tends to respond with these massacres of Turkey to return the ancient Hagia Sofia monument to the mosque, has caused harsh criticism between Athens and Ankara.Sanctions on Turkey, Greek businesses have already begun a boycott of goods and services from the neighboring country.We are aware of the efforts that the (Greek) government is making in response to Hagia Sofia's conversion, he said.But until this is refined in something concrete, Korkidis said, Greek businesses should not be lost to boycott trade with their Turkish partners. Even on a personal level, he says, consumers should do the same.They, Korkidis said, can do so immediately, by boycotting Turkish malls holding the numbers 868 and 869 on the barcode of imported products. All of the old hostility between the two countries, the trade relations have increased significantly in recent years.Greece's annual exports at about $ 1.6 billion, much more than 1.2 billion imports of imports from Turkey.

The trade business is just one of the many protests that expand to Greece.Thousands of people sang hymns in honor of Hagia Sofia, the Eastern Christian headquarters for a thousand years, before the Ottoman Turks occupied the well -known city as Constantinople.Turkish flag.Aagrekah condemned the action.Still, the government encouraged nationalist passions a harsh criticism of Turkey by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

"7 parts of the body that say a lot about your inner personality and why building your body is based on our DNA (genetics) rather than our personal aesthetic preference, there are still parts of your body that can convey many things about personalitySome studies suggest that genetics can determine many things about our future and how we perceive the world through our genes. We have found 8 scientific studies about body parts that convey some interesting things to our personality: 1.The shape of the nose is special in its own way. However, according to the study conducted by the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery in 2013, the tissues that connect the bones and form your nose can convey a number of things about one's personality.They studied about 1,700 pictures of people's noses and categorized them all in 14 species. They analyzed their nose shapes and placed their findings. Long nose people are very ambitious in their professional lives and are very hardworking people. They tend toare perfect and usually put their professional lives at first and their second personal life. However, people with shorter noses are very sensitive and loyal individuals. They value feelings more than anything and they better willto be happy in their family than to have a successful career. People with a sharp nose can make great financial advisers because they tend to treat their money wisely and people with nose have issues ofhuge engagement is a sign that someone likes to spend money instead of saving it and small noses show a strong commitment to personal relationships and family.2.Human facial shape has a very complex structure that can say a lot about the social and personal functions of an individual.Cesare Lombroso, the founder of criminal anthropology, argued that any crime can be determined by the facial structure of the person who commits it. A study published in PLOS One Journal in 2014 received 160 participants and asked them to appreciate the IQ of 80 students as men and women through their single pictures. Study found that people with long faces are knownThey are very intelligent individuals while people with a narrow facial structure have emotionally coefficient and non -intelligent. Study also found that people with wide faces are more likely to be prejudiced, emotionally and very successful.3.The color of the circumcisived both personality and eye structure are related to the frontal lobe of the brain that is responsible for the formation of our personality. People with large brown eyes are natural innate leaders and very intelligent individuals and people with many eyesdark brown are introvert, mysterious and secret. Blue -eyed people have a lot of internal strength and they tend to be very competitive, while people with dark blue eyes are found to have a lot of physical strength and are very sensitiveDark -eyed people are discovered more introverted and mysterious, while people with light eyes are more visible and social.4.The shape of the eye for thousands of years, facial reading experts believed that the shape of your eyes can accurately show the hidden qualities of one's character because of the structure of the skull bones. Wide -eyed people tend to be more expressive and emotionalin their personal lives. They are very detailed oriented and want to be very careful, generally. The big -eyed individuals tend to be open, intelligent and friendly. When one's eyes are small and wide, this means that they are introverted perfectionists. Deeply set -eyed people tend to be mysterious, attentive and intense. The almonds show passion and romance, while people with close eyes tend to be strong individualsand persistent.7.If the finger of the ring is longer than the index finger, it means you are a very charming individual and tend to take more risks in your personal and professional life. If your index finger is longer than your fingerring, this means you are a naturally born leader. And finally, if the ring finger and index finger are the same length this means you are a good communicator and you know how to keepthe balance",1

"Stop continuing talks in Brussels without American presence and monitoring, writes: Rexhep Shah “Kosovo has been liberated from America and NATO and should not agree to make fun of EU racist officials with Kosovo.Kosovo worse than it was.Serbia can no longer return to Kosovo anymore.Kosovo needs dignified officials to succeed and do not need to be serviced like Serbia.I have been and am for him, that at every table of talks, the conditions are set by Kosovo and the talks should not continue without presence and without American monitoring.The least is a diplomatic scandal, what the EU Enlargement Commissioner did with his excitement about the book donated by Vuciqi.Provocative, not dignified by EU officials and the Enlargement Commissioner, even prejudiced for Kosovo's own status.The beginning of the dialogue with Serbia, at the first meeting between Avdullah Hoti and Alexander Vuqiqi, which took place in Brussels, set out with an ugly taste that the dishonest meeting of Vucic with Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Vahrleyi, at the Serbian mission office,It was also deliberately set to the book entitled ""Kosovo and Metohija"", where Vucic received the Commissioner with traditional Serbian pogacies.The presence of the book entitled ""The Christian Heritage in Kosovo and Metohi"" near the European Commissioner for Enlargement has prompted numerous reactions including the Kosovo MFA but has not affected the meeting between Hoti and Vucic.Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Meliza Haradinaj, also reacted to this diplomatic provocation, through a post on her Facebook account, where she said that this is beyond the diplomatic scandal deliberate exposure of chauvinistic books.Provocative book entitled ""The Christian Heritage of Kosovo and Metohija - The Historical and Spiritual Heartland of Serbia"", exposed on the EU Commissioner's desk that for enlargement, Oliver Varhelyit, is the EU's scandal and body, aftervisa liberalization for Kosovo Albanians!Commissioner Varhelyi, did not know how to be neutral, he was used to believe with his wish and became an open fan of Serbs, went to the Serbian embassy headquarters in Brussels, feasted and appeared as a Serbian militant with the Serbian book ahead.It seems that Kosovo has fallen as well as political scholarships. Lexoni also: temperatures rise today in Kosovo begins drastic fall with the ridicule and ridicule made by Albin Kurti America by lashing up Amelika Amelika, challenging America, mentioning knives in the White House on the map of Kosovo.Then the drastic fall of the scholarship for Albanian Kosovo occurred with the accusations against Thaci and his dignity to go to Hage as an individual, as an Hashim and not as president of Kosovo.The fragile government in Pristina should not be bent.The European Union where Serbia has seduced is disoriented for itself.America that sets the rules of movement of the world is in the election campaign.Europe can make no decision for Kosovo without approval and American presence.European diplomats do not even dare to laugh no longer to make decisions without American presence and approval regarding the future of Kosovo.Kosovo is not enough to react to the minister on FB, Kosovo does not need to be serviced to anyone that nothing is worthwhile with servitude, Kosovo is only overshadowed by dignity and pride, it must use its presence on the world tables and expose gamesthe Serbian bubbles and the filthy alliances.

The year is 2022 and the Korona virus is finally defeated after a year and a half of misery and change of new quarantine and waves, life is finally starting to return to normal.So begins the ""New York Times"" the text in which he tries to discover what life might look like in 2022, as the world has agreed with pandemia.

Economists interviewed by the New York Times believe that companies with bad business models will suffer, even though they do well before the pandemics. Victims will be local media, which are already fighting forSurvival, as well as the traditional concept of shopping in stores, and the virus is also exacerbating all existing problems in educational systems and the operation of universities. Educations will certainly vary for students, students and employees.Meetings can be held permanently through applications such as ""Zoom"" and ""Google Meet"".Some big companies in America have already told their employees that they will probably work from home forever, and business facilities, if that happens, will lose their primary function.in the political plan.And the way politics will work will have the power to shape all other aspects of our lives",1

"Serbian media: The Government of Kosovo again in the hands of Serbia, Albanians on their knees.Serbia and America The key spelling of Serbian media translated (without intervention): a month after the overthrow of the Government of Provisional Institutions led by Albin Kurti, the Government in Kosovo received a new majority led by Isa Mustafa and Ramush Haradinaj.Their partner will also be the Serbian List, so all decisions will depend on the votes of the Serbs.The point is whether the new government is in line with the Constitution and will it survive because it lacks full legitimacy. Nexhmedin Spahiu, a Kosovo political analyst, says there is a big difference between the previous government and this government. - Unlike itPreviously, this government will depend on the Serbian List.Which means that whenever the Serbian List fails to believe, this government can fall.This was not the case with the previous government, which did not depend on Serbian votes.Second, in this government, the Serbian List fought to have a deputy prime minister and assured that the Serbian community holds positions at every level - says Spahiu.opposition votes in its ranks.Asked if the role of Srpska in the new Government of the Provisional Institutions of Kosovo will speed up the Belgrade-Pristina negotiation process and lift the fees, Spahiu says:-Tariffs have already been abolished, such a decision has already been made in the government ofprevious.Measures of reciprocity were merely an empty decision, because they had to be determined later, when negotiations began, but it was nothing and it was only an empty word.Judicial in the Constitutional Court to review Thaci's decision to trust another mandate to form a government, thus violating a rule adopted in 2014 so that only the first party has the right to mandate.SpahiuHe believes that negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina will continue, but that Americans will play a major role.If someone in Pristina wants to get into the game, as Albin Kurti wanted, then he and Kurti will be out of the game - concludes Spahiu.Stefan Filipovic, a political analyst from Kosovo, believes this government of the temporary institutions of Pristina willShort life.- This government is a kind of transitional technical government until new elections, because it can only be legitimacy.For any other serious political history this government will not have full democratic capacities.I expect the Self -Determination Movement to show the illegality and undemocratic nature of this government and will try to challenge its legality - is convinced Filipovic. He believes that there will be political consensus at one point to go to the polls and, he says,sooner than we think. - Even yesterday, Kadri Veseli officially stated that after the end of the pandemic, Kosovo will have new elections and in general, the PDK shows that they are not very interested in this new government, that they will support itLDK, but this is a temporary solution until the new elections-he says Filipovic.Filipovic expects Curti to act as an angry opposition until there are new elections.Regarding negotiations with Belgrade, Filipovic believes everything will wait until elections in Belgrade are completed.To happen as a sign of good will - he is convinced.The next should be signed by the sides of Bedzol Pacolli, Fatmir Limaj, Srpska List and minorities that are also part of the agreement.Otherwise, as the media in the Albanian language reports of Pristina report, in addition to continuing the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, ie the efforts of Kosovo's institutions to combat the spread of the virus corona, the text of the signed agreement also states that the goal is Kosovo's membership inKB, EU, NATO and other international organizations.Organization",0

Read: gives resignation from the PDK, the reason that it was ""ruined"" for the party!CNN, Sanborn knew that some of the world's greatest intelligence officers would pass by it every day, so he decided to create a work of art that would challenge them.Sanborn assumed that his encrypted puzzle would be hit most in a few weeks.It wasn't. ""I didn't think it would go on for so long - thirty years - without deciphering,"" Sanborn CNN.Sot, Kryptos, told one of the most famous mysteries in the world.Wide, Kryptos is a curved, screen -shaped statue, made of copper and resembles the shape of a half -open roll.Its entire surface is full of cut letters, nearly 2,000 of them, which Sanborn says he ""cut them with arrows, by hand"". Sanborn claims to contain four coded messages that when joining, forman enigma.But only three of the hidden messages have been deciphered over the years. The first message states: ""Between the delicate shadow and the lack of light lies the nuance of the calculation.""Sanborn mistakenly wrote the word ""illusion"" in an attempt to remove people, which he seems to have accomplished quite successfully. The second message contains coordinates for the CIA headquarters, and hints that something is buried there.The message also mentions the initials ""h"", most likely referring to William Webster, head of the CIA in 1990, in the same year Kryptos was installed.

Such conclusions are a consequence of processes that are more than visible in Serbian society, especially in Serbian patriotic circles among those who know Russia andIndeed defend the friendship of our peoples. In recent months, this foreign policy course has been significantly accelerated, and the open anti-Russian campaign in the media near the Progressive Serbian Party and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has become increasingly clear.It is mainly, though not exclusively, for the yellow press, whose unofficial editor is Vucic's adviser, Vladimir Beba Popovic, the joint denominator of Vucic and Djukanovic. Historically, the situation inevitably remembers 1948 and preparation for ""no""-In the well-known Josip Broz Tito, who marked the onset of the cold conflict of the former Yugoslavia, on the one hand, and Stalin, the USSR (until then the most important foreign policy partner) and with all Informmburo,On the other hand.

Zaten, after recent protests against the restoration of the police clock to fight the Korona virus, has launched the most open anti-Russian campaign in Serbia in the last 20 years. There was no media, television and newspaperthat did not report on Russia's alleged involvement in organizing violent protests in Belgrade. Even the deputy mayor of Belgrade, Goran Vesic, has mentioned me as one of the main organizers of these protests, which is an absolute nonsense.He served many tabloids to build a whole series of absurd accusations against prominent Russian people, true friends of Serbia and the Serbian people, due to their alleged involvement in organizing the protest."", Which in the"" deep Russian state, that behind Putin's back wants to overthrow Alexander Vucic "", even included Svetlana Medvedev, the wife of former Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev, then Leonid Reshatnikov, director of the two-sided Eagle Fund"", And the former director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research, Jevgenij Primakov mentioned earlier, and even the Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Support Fund. After denying such claims by Ambassador Bocan-Kharchenko, editor-in-chief of"" Srpski Teleraf"", Milan Negjevic gave the Russian Embassy want to stimulate freedom of speech in Serbia, and went to pro-government Pink television, where he and Vucic's ex-wife, Ksenija Vucic, almost accused Russia of being guilty of aggressionNATO against Yugoslavia in 1999. The answer to the question of why antirial hysteria is happening in Serbia in this form is now very simple: the reason is the continuation of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina on the status of Kosovo.Albanian and European, it is openly said that negotiations on an agreement on the comprehensive normalization of relations are close to the conclusion, with what Kosovo would gain the right to KB membership, even without direct recognition by Serbia (like relations between the two Germans)Since such an act would be an act of betrayal of Serbia, contrary to the Constitution of our country and resolution KS 1244, Vucic is distanced from Russia as the only guarantor of their preservation at the moment.

A turbine operating in running water can constantly produce enough electricity to store up to 20 houses.Slow -flowing water, which means they can be used in rivers and irrigation canals, as well as in the ocean.Islands and resorts, ”Douglas Hunt, managing director of Mako Energy, told CNN Business. An alternative to coal? Although tidal energy is still in its infancy, it can help reduce Australia's dependence on fossil fuels.”Most of the energy in the national network is from coal, ”explained Jenny Hayward, a research scientist at the Australian National Sciences Agency, Csiro.""

We know that the masks in no case do not prevent us from breathing, even those who have 12 hours for 12 hoursKeep it in certain areas and units. In Kosovo there are few studies to argue that the masks helped in the pandemic, but we can easily find the facts with an online search.The mask in the public has become mandatory. Its deployment became punitive by law.It is precisely the implementation of such rules, especially the establishment of a mask by all, without exception, that Germany manages better with the situation of the Pandemic Covid-19.German health has come in accordance that setting a simple mask properly-can greatly reduce the transmission of the coronavirus ”(https: //www.thelocal.de/20200416/that-does-germanys-Recommendation-To-e-face-mask-mean) In addition to false news that the mask does not help prevent the virus in the public we continue to see bad messages and examples of how masks are placed. Many times we have a doctor's professionDiscuss how the mask is being mistaken by many people we are seeing on the road. Worst of all that many health profession have made pencils like many of the population in setting the mask.The couple who entered the bus was left out at all, or others who were leaving the mask under the chin, or even the other group they had not decided at all. We have attempted with a group of people to explain on social networks how to properly explainmasks are placed. The mass should be caught for the ""rubber"" with your fingers and put on the ears and placed in such a way to cover the mouth and nose, both should be covered.When the state is no longer occupied with the politics of their chair, to become a continuous media education to set the mask because: ""Dude, you are doing it work!Remove it at all and not contaminating it. A rationale that has happened to me to hear that they are not able to breathe, if you have a breath. Let me tell them an experiment that a doctor has done to convince peopledifferent that does not change breathing with masks.It puts many masks one on one, measuring saturation (supply of oxygen to the body) and the results are that the supply is in order. I mentioned the third group that does not put the mask at all.These are Kogja Kapdai, and the safe kogja in herself, and we see these exactly the hassle.I.e.For this group it looks like all these rules and the work of the virus is not worthwhile.

So, sometimes the population is not to blame when such an example of ""grazing"" comes from the rulers. What can we say all this?: Come on eating, come on ...! Like the myth that the virus does not exist and the myth that even the mask does not do the job.It is to be masked, that they are not inviolable either, and that the law is one for all.

"""Why has Intubs not succeeded?"", Anesthetist gives details of patient treatment and talks about the great risk: Here's what happens to patients during intubation and why has he not been expected?Painful reported by the Ministry of Health, for loss of life for intubated patients, anesthetist Nard Tetaj has given some details, showing what the protocol is currently followed.One that is decreasing therefore there is a decrease in patients with Covid and epidemics that are growing. During an interview in the ""ABC morning"", he said that Albania has pursued an almost similar policy to Italy.But he added that now that people from other countries also enter the virus faster., as the medication increases even more and thus decreases the immune system of patients. “Lactoferin is a protein that has protective effects on bacteria and viruses.From the known effects are experiments whether or not it works for Covid and is still in the early stages (in the lab stages).Lactoferine is found in the pharmacy and is taken by many people is simply for its protective effects, but not as a medicine.There are no side effects, but so far no safe effects have been seen to be statistically significant that work on the virus is simply a hypothesis and it remains to be seen whether it will work or not, ”the doctor explained.During this time? ”We have changed protocols several times as it has been done all over the world.We have seen those working up to some extent, not 100%.They are Remdesivir as well as a cortisone called dexamethasone, ”he said. Why did the intubation have not had the success that was probably expected?To keep an intubated patient we need to give her medication to sleep all the time.Those medicines reduce the immune system even more. Then there may be predisposition to other infections, normal bacteria infections that a normal peron does not get, but those who have lower immune system get.There is a condition that the patient has Covid-19, but also other bacterial infections, both in the blood and in the lungs. In this way a severe form of the patient is called ""shock"" and has a very high mortality.When patients are intubated there should be great care from specialists, the medication is added even more.The mortality rate in intubated patients is about 25 %.

What gives it the woman, not the man who gives her, so she gives.One side asks, the other one decides to give it or not, it is made as a sale: the vagina.Some think they have it from gold, like my work, here we are called ""lesbian"".But we are not talking about these cases, we are talking about those who are generous.Those who give it the first night. The wife gives, but actually accepts another idea of ​​the passive, submissive woman, but not because she is oppressed by the man, but in the sense that the woman always has a behavior ""host ”and not active.We say a man more strongly, not come to *i.So we invite it to do something: we put in the position of suffering something (with desire and approval, definitely).On the other hand, the animals also join in that position, 90 degrees, during which female sex is subjected to the male.Perhaps the idea of ​​the woman who is expecting something depends on the physiology and anatomy of our bodies: something that needs to come in and something to come out.When you think of a current spine, think about the spine approaching the wall and not the other way around.The night is unprecedented, it is not a whore.We are in 2020 and this judgment still continues.This cliché comes from another cliche who still sees the man as an invader.While a man who is very successful with the girls is victorious.A man who fails to succeed more women is a failed.The truth is that men are no longer accustomed to women's independence and their social, economic, emotional evolution.They have not been so accustomed to that often these signs of independence are misinterpreted (not by all) and usually, the punishment comes in barbaric ways. Do you not believe me?Example here: if a woman talks about sex education, sex, what she likes and does not like for sure is a where*puts.If you have a condom, lubricant or any sex toy for what you need, where*do you?Do you give it to the first meeting?You are where you are used to be, very few think that if you talk without barriers is because a free, courageous and very proud woman is.You are a woman who manages yourself and your sex life.You have a condom because you take care of your health and do not want to have any sexual illness.If you give it to the first meeting it is because you have decided freely and consciously, that he likes and you do not need strategy: you will get what you want and point.Because the evening was nice and you like it, you are both excited, and you have no motive to think that you should not do the first day. In fact having sex the first night has a great advantage (except desiresCompleted), if you have bad sex, you will find out immediately.So you will know immediately if it is added to the list of those I have baptized as #mikropenisa.Or will you find out after a month, during which you probably idealized and maybe lovers?Sex is an important factor that cannot be overlooked.Better to have a check up.To having sex in the first meeting does not do you wrong, to go out with a raft makes you bad.Because relationships between people have many problems, without having to treat sex as a problem./ Tabu (Kosova Sot Online",1
